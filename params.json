{"name":"Resizer","body":"Resizer\r\n=======\r\n\r\nResizer is a small command-line utility written in [Go](http://golang.org/).\r\n\r\nThe primary intended use for resizer is to pad images to a standard 4:3 or 3:2\r\nratio so that it could be printed through popular online print services.\r\n\r\nIndeed, online photo print services such as apple, negatifplus follow a rather\r\nstupid logic that leads to loss of image information when supplied with\r\nnon-standard ratio images: they just crop the picture to fit the chosen\r\nstandard ratio.\r\n\r\nIt nicely selects the closest standard ratio if none is given as an argument.\r\nOh, and default \"gravity\" is not center, so we don't have to crop twice ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use it?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n[Install Go 1](http://golang.org/doc/install) and run this command:\r\n\r\n    go run resizer.go -dir=resized -color=white -ratio=40:60 image1 image2 ...\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nâ™¡2012 by Bruno Michel.
